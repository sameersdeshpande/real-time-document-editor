# Real-Time Document Editor

## Overview

The **Real-Time Document Editor** is a collaborative, cloud-based platform that allows multiple users to edit and share documents simultaneously. It provides real-time updates, version control, and seamless collaboration, allowing users to work together from anywhere. This project leverages modern web technologies like WebSockets, Node.js, and a rich front-end framework to create an intuitive and fast document editing experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit the document simultaneously, with changes instantly reflected for all participants.
- **Version History**: Track changes over time with a built-in version control system, enabling easy rollback to previous versions.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management to ensure only authorized access to documents.
- **Rich Text Editing**: Includes features like text formatting, inserting images, tables, and lists.
- **Offline Mode**: Users can continue editing even when offline, with changes syncing when the connection is restored.
- **Document Sharing**: Share documents with others via links or invite collaborators to specific documents.
- **Comments and Annotations**: Collaborators can leave comments and annotations on the document, facilitating feedback and discussion.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Quill.js (for rich text editing)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for user data and document storage)
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket (Socket.io for bidirectional communication)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Hosting**: Heroku or AWS (for deployment)
